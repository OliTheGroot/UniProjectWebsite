		Welcome to our website, where a passionate interdisciplinary team collaborates to develop
		professional websites for a major non-profit organization dedicated to combating climate change.
		Our primary goal is to establish transparency on annual CO² emissions from companies and
		countries through a publicly accessible platform.
	</p>
	<p>
		In merging environmental science, data analysis, web development, and design, we aim to create a
		user-friendly space that vividly presents CO² emissions. Our vision includes not only providing
		detailed insights into company and country emissions but also offering tips and tricks on what
		individuals can do personally to address climate change. Join us in exploring the website for
		updates on our progress and discover actionable ways to contribute to the fight against climate
		change. Together, let's pave the way for a more sustainable future.
